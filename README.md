<h2>Hey there 👋</h2>

I'm **Arjun Shah** — a current **M.S. in Computer Science** student at **Georgia Tech** 🐝.  

💡 **A bit about me:**
- 🎓 Graduated from **Rutgers University** (B.S. in Computer Science)
- 🚀 I enjoy exploring a wide range of computer science topics,  
  but I’m especially passionate about **full stack development (front end and back end)**,  
  and building things close to the metal — from system-level tools  
  to backend logic that keeps everything running smoothly
- 🧠 Constantly exploring new technologies and improving my craft

🔒 Some of my most interesting projects are **private**, but feel free to reach out — I’d be happy to talk about what I’m working on!
